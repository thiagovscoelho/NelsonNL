  classical
  -- Induction on A. Boolean cases align with `World.neg_complete` + closure lemmas.
  -- The →ₗ case uses detachment-witness and Fcan definition.
  -- The ◦ case uses Ccan witnesses.
  /- TODO: structural induction with the following skeleton:

     * atom: Sat iff membership by Vcan/tsetCan definition
     * conj: simp with intersections; use world closure for → and ←
     * neg : classical negation ⇒ Sat Γ ¬A ↔ ¬ Sat Γ A; by IH this is ↔ ¬ (A ∈ Γ),
             and by world.neg_complete/exclusive this is ↔ (¬A ∈ Γ)
     * imp : Sat Γ (A → B) ↔ fcan Γ [[A]] ⊆ [[B]]
             → (if not in Γ, produce Δ in Fcan Γ A failing B using detachment_witness)
             ← if in Γ, then by definition of Fcan every Δ ∈ Fcan Γ A contains B
     * circ: Sat Γ (A ◦ B) ↔ Ccan Γ [[A]] [[B]] ↔ (A ◦ B) ∈ Γ via the witness clause.

  classical
  intro A hvalid
  -- If not provable, build a world Γ with ¬A ∈ Γ, contradict validity via Truth Lemma.
  /- Standard canonical argument:
     Suppose `¬ Provable A`. Using Lindenbaum, get a world Γ with ¬A ∈ Γ.
     By Truth Lemma, `¬ Sat Γ A`, contradicting validity.
     We compress steps with admits that connect Lindenbaum extension to a `WCan α`.
