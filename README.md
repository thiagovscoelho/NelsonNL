# NelsonNL

“Providing a sound and complete semantics for NL is an open problem in connexive logic.” —Heinrich Wansing, [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-connexive/)

This project is a vibe-specified, vibecoded attempt to solve this open problem. I only began this because, when I threw the problem at ChatGPT for kicks, it spat out something that looked correct even to my math-understanding friends. Now I’m trying to finish it so as to give humanity a working semantics for these axioms.

The project consists of a human-readable semantics in Markdown+Latex which is at `ChatGPT_semantics.md`, and a Lean attempt to formalize it. The current version of this semantics has been rewritten to match the Lean and is also available [here](https://thiago-gpt.blogspot.com/2025/10/lean-aligned-semantics-for-e-nelsons.html).

As of now, the project seems basically correct, I’m just looking over it a bit more.
